        <h2>Verified:</h2>
        <p>
            Devices with a “Verified” badge indicate that the entire verification process through our advanced
            technology has been successfully completed. The device undergoes 50+ automated checks and the essential
            components like the hardware, sensors, camera, vibration, WiFi of the phone have been tested thoroughly and
            have been graded accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>The overall check-up of the device has been done through the ORUphones app and thus, has been verified.</p>

        <h2>Unverified:</h2>
        <p>Devices that have not been verified fall under the “Unverified” category. To get verified, verification must
            be done using the ORUphones app, which has to be installed in the same device.</p>
        <p>
            Our latest technology verifies all the internal components of the device and only then claims the device as
            verified. You can request for the verification by selecting the ‘Request verification' option.
