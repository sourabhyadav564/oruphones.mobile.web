      <h1>Device verification</h1>
      <h2>Verified:</h2>
      <p>
        The device has gone through the whole verification process of our latest AI tech. All the essential parts of the mobile have been tested
        thoroughly and have been graded accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>The overall check-up of the device has been through our ORUphones app and thus, has been verified. It is safe from viruses and a good device.</p>

      <h2>Unverified:</h2>
      <p>This device has not been verified yet. The verification must be done using the ORUphones app, which has to be installed in the same device.</p>
      <p>
        Our latest tech verifies all the internal components of the device and only then claims the device as verified. You can request for the
        verification by selecting the â€˜Request verification' option.
