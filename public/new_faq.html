        <h1>General Features</h1>
        <p><strong>Que.  What is the website ORUphones?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ans.</strong> ORUphones is India&rsquo;s first and best online platform where you can buy and sell a
            variety of used, old &amp; refurbished mobiles from the comfort of your home. Our latest A.I technology and
            review team gets you the best deals for your mobile and the best of mobiles at an amazing price.</p>
        <p><strong>Que.  What is the goal of ORUphones?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ans.</strong> The goal of ORUphones is to make the trading of used phones more profitable, safer,
            reliable and convenient for both buyers and sellers of used phones. The prices of Used phones and
            refurbished phones are heavily inflated as the device goes through many hands/middleman before it reaches
            the end user. Most of the online shops/platforms charge heavy commissions &amp; premiums. They try to
            justify these prices by tagging these phones as refurbished. But in most cases these phones are not going
            through the refurbishment process. At ORUphones it is made sure that both buyers and sellers get the best
            deals available in the market because sellers/buyers do not have to pay any commission to anyone.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Que.  How is ORUphones different from classified sites like Quikr or OLX?</strong></p> 
        <p><strong>Ans.</strong>&nbsp; 1. Quikr and OLX, are marketplaces that enable sellers and buyers to connect.
            They
            are not involved in checking and verification of the authenticity of the device. ORUphones, on the other
            hand, verifies whether the device registered is in a working condition with our 50+ points automated checks.
            &nbsp;We do not act as a third party between your mobile deals, we rather act as a free platform where
            genuine sellers and buyers can interact and get a great deal.</p>
        <p>2. On our platform, you can also check prices from other vendors and compare. This helps you in making an
            informed decision whether you want to buy a used phone or sell your old phone.</p>
        <p>3. You can not only just buy/sell your old phone at ORU but can also enjoy a host of other services &amp;
            features for free.&nbsp;</p>
