        <p><strong>Que. What is Oru?</strong><br /><strong>Ans.</strong> Oru is India&rsquo;s first and best online
            platform where you can buy and sell a variety of refurbished mobiles from the comfort of your home. Our
            latest A.I. tech and review team gets you the best of deals for your mobile and the best of mobiles in an
            amazing price.</p>
        <p>ORU is India&rsquo;s first ever online marketplace dedicated for buying &amp; selling old, refurbished and
            used mobiles/smartphones. Our goal is to make used phones trading more profitable, safer, reliable and
            convenient for both buyers and sellers of used phones.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Used phones/refurbished phones prices are heavily inflated as the device goes through many hands/middleman
            before it reaches you. Most of the online shops/platforms charge heavy commissions &amp; premiums. They try
            to justify the prices by tagging these phones as refurbished. But in most cases these phones are not going
            through the refurbishment process.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We at ORU will make sure that both buyers and sellers get the best deals available in the market because
            sellers/buyers do not have to pay any commission to anyone.&nbsp;</p>

            need
            to verify the condition of your device. For that, you need to install the Oru app on the same device. The
            Oru app will test the device based on its speaker quality, display, Mike and other attributes and then will
            assign a grade to the device.</p>
        <p><strong>Que. What does verified seller mean?</strong><br /><strong>Ans.</strong> Oru displays a seller on the
            platform only after verifying him and his device. After successful verification, the seller is badged as a

            the Oru app.</p>
        <p><strong>Que. Why should I trust a verified seller?</strong><br /><strong>Ans.</strong> The badge of
            &lsquo;verified seller&rsquo; means that the seller and his device, both have been verified by our A.I. tech

            made live after the review is done. Or the listing has been rejected due to quality issues. In either of
            these cases, you will be informed timely.</p>

            team based on various quality and verification related attributes. Any listing may be rejected if it fails
            to pass the review test. It is usually rejected when the listing contains some objectionable or insensitive
            image or the device failed to pass the quality check. In either of these cases, the listing gets rejected.

            user&rsquo;s account if the user seems not to follow the terms and conditions of Oru. Crossing the
            boundaries of these conditions or posting inappropriate images in a listing may result in the termination of
            your account. If you feel the decision to be wrong, you can contact us through mail.</p>
