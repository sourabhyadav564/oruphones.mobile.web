            <p className="font-Roboto-Regular"><strong className="font-Semibold">Que. What is Oru?</strong><br /><strong className="font-Semibold">Ans.</strong> Oru is India&rsquo;s first and best online
              platform where you can buy and sell a variety of refurbished mobiles from the comfort of your home. Our
              latest A.I. tech and review team gets you the best of deals for your mobile and the best of mobiles in an
              amazing price.</p>
            <p class>ORU is India&rsquo;s first ever online marketplace dedicated for buying &amp; selling old, refurbished and
              used mobiles/smartphones. Our goal is to make used phones trading more profitable, safer, reliable and
              convenient for both buyers and sellers of used phones.&nbsp;</p>
            <p className="font-Roboto-Regular">Used phones/refurbished phones prices are heavily inflated as the device goes through many hands/middleman
              before it reaches you. Most of the online shops/platforms charge heavy commissions &amp; premiums. They try
              to justify the prices by tagging these phones as refurbished. But in most cases these phones are not going
              through the refurbishment process.&nbsp;</p>
            <p className="font-Roboto-Regular">We at ORU will make sure that both buyers and sellers get the best deals available in the market because
              sellers/buyers do not have to pay any commission to anyone.&nbsp;</p>
