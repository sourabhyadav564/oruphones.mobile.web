          <h2>Why should you buy used phones on ORUphones? </h2>
          <p>
            1. Save more and buy from direct sellers:&nbsp;Did you know that 90%
            of the devices sold as refurbished phones on other websites do not
            undergo any refurbishment process? This means you are paying a hefty
            charge for a used phone that you could have bought for a nominal
            price directly from the seller. We help customers who are looking
            for a sweet deal in the used phone market by connecting you directly
            with genuine sellers so that you don&apos;t pay a heavy fee of
            commissions or the middleman charges.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Verified sellers/devices:&nbsp;ORUphones provide an option to
            verify every seller/device before displaying them on a reselling
            platform. Unlike Quikr or OLX, we ensure that all the verified
            devices you buy are in working condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Best Deal:&nbsp;ORUphones uses an AI-based recommendation engine
            to find the best deal on a particular device model from thousands of
            deals.
